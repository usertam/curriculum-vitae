  "Bleeding-edge LLVM toolchains for cross-compilation, optimized with PGO and LTO.",
  "June 2024",
  "usertam/toolchain"
)[
  Leveraging GitHub Actions with scheduled scripts, we can perform weekly builds against the LLVM #link("https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project", `master`). The build is then optimized, stripped and patched for portability across different environments.

#gh_item(
  ConTeXt + "-minimals" + dot + "200+ releases",
  "Typesetting system made reproducible.",

  "usertam/context-minimals"
)[
  After analyzing the dependencies of #ConTeXt LMTX (like #LaTeX, derived from #TeX), we rewrite the installation declaratively in `nix`. This results in a far more efficient installation that is both reproducible and portable.

  We use open-source kernel trees released by Qualcomm, with upstream changes and custom patches to rebuild the Android kernel, enabling support for custom kernel features (e.g. namespaces for containers).
